# Cover Letter: Senior Data Engineer

To the CircleCI Hiring Team,

As a Senior Data Engineer with over 15 years of experience building and optimizing large-scale data systems, I have long admired CircleCI as the gold standard for CI/CD and engineering productivity. My career has been defined by a transition from traditional database management to architecting modern, high-leverage cloud data platforms, making me uniquely positioned to help shape the future of CircleCI’s data infrastructure.

In my most recent role at McKinsey, I have focused on evolving data platforms to meet the needs of an Agile environment, emphasizing scalability and automated deployment. Previously at Forma.AI, I specialized in distributed processing using PySpark and Databricks on AWS—experience that aligns directly with your need for engineers who can handle terabyte-scale data and sophisticated modeling. 

I am particularly drawn to this role because of CircleCI’s focus on building frameworks that multiply team effectiveness. Throughout my career, including my leadership tenure at IBM Brazil, I have prioritized creating reusable tools and internal platforms that empower analysts and engineers to work independently. I bring deep expertise in performance optimization and cost modeling across AWS and GCP, ensuring that technical excellence always balances with business pragmatism.

I am excited about the possibility of bringing my background in distributed systems, performance tuning, and technical leadership to CircleCI. Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

Açaoy Saracchini
