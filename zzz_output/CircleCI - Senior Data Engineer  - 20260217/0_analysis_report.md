# Analysis: Senior Data Engineer 

Score: 6 -> 8.5

### Fit Analysis
Açaoy is a seasoned data professional with 18+ years of experience, transitioning from a legacy DBA/SQL background into modern cloud data engineering. His strengths include architectural leadership at IBM and recent work with Databricks/AWS at Forma.AI and McKinsey. He fits the 'Senior' seniority level perfectly. However, the lack of explicit Snowflake experience (a JD 'strong preference') and direct AI/ML infrastructure work prevents a 10/10. His strong foundations in distributed systems and performance optimization make him a highly viable candidate for a platform-centric role.

### Missing Skills (Gaps)
- Direct Snowflake expertise (JD lists as strongly preferred).
- Explicit experience with dbt and Airflow (JD core requirements).
- Experience with streaming systems (Kafka/Flink) - listed as bonus.
- AI/ML pipeline/Feature store development experience.
